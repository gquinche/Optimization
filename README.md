# Optimization in Julia
This are ***reproducible Notebooks!*** one uses Pluto and the other Jupyter and both run in a Binder session.

To visit the most up to date proyect click [here](https://gquinche.github.io/Optimization/ConeHull)

To execute the Notebook go to the right corner, this will take a little but download all dependencies.



For the previous project click in this button
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gquinche/Optimization/HEAD)

Sometimes after theres an error you only need to ***reload*** the page, also when binder gets you to the jupyter hub just start demo.py

Feel free to add issues to the github repo
