# This is my Optimization project presented to you in Julia with Binder
 
To execute the Notebook
Click the button below and it will launch an interactive Julia environment:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gquinche/Optimization/HEAD)

Sometimes after theres an error you only need to ***reload*** the page, also when binder gets you to the jupyter hub just start demo.py
altough this is a longer setup you can just let it run for 5 or 6 minutes and you will get a totally ***reproducible Notebook!***
Feel free to add issues for corrections to the content of it
